ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was consummated on August 30, 2002.</P>

Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment (collectively, our ?Downstream business?), were transferred to Phillips 66. As a part of our strategic asset disposition program, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we agreed to sell our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and our Nigerian and Algerian businesses. Results of operations related to Phillips 66, Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Average production from continuing operations decreased 2 percent in 2012, primarily as a result of normal field decline, the impact from asset dispositions and higher planned and unplanned downtime. These decreases were largely offset by additional production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48 and ramp-up of new phases at FCCL, the resumption of production in Libya following a period of civil unrest in 2011, and increased drilling programs in the Lower 48.</P>

In response to this expropriation, we filed a request for international arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the World Bank?s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). An arbitration hearing was held before an ICSID tribunal during the summer of 2010, and we anticipate an interim decision on key legal and factual issues in 2013. In a separate commercial arbitration from the Company?s ICSID claim discussed above, an International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) tribunal issued a decision in favor of the Company in September 2012, finding PDVSA owed $67 million for pre-expropriation breaches of the Petrozuata project agreements. In November 2012, based on the ICC tribunal ruling, PDVSA paid ConocoPhillips $68 million, including post-judgment interest, which resulted in a $61 million after-tax earnings increase.

In 2009, Ecuador took over operations in Blocks 7 and 21, fully expropriating our assets. In June 2010, the ICSID tribunal concluded it has jurisdiction to hear the expropriation claim. On April 24, 2012, Ecuador filed a supplemental counterclaim asserting environmental damages, which we believe are not material. The ICSID tribunal issued a decision on liability on December 14, 2012, in favor of Burlington, finding that Ecuador?s seizure of Blocks 7 and 21 was an unlawful expropriation in violation of the Ecuador-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty.

In certain locations, governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on our operations; special taxes or tax assessments; and payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause us to violate non-disclosure laws of other countries. The U.S. government can also prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by host governments have affected operations significantly in the past, such as the expropriation of our oil assets by the Venezuelan government, and may continue to do so in the future.</P>
