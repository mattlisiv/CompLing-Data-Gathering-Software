The markets for software and related services, especially highly-available connected services, are characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Competition and expertise in many of the markets we serve, particularly small business services and consumer tax, have grown over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. There are also large, cloud-based service companies who innovate quickly and serve small businesses and consumers. While today our competition with such companies may be limited, as we and those companies grow, our competition with them may increase. In recent years the widespread availability of the Internet, the emergence of mobile devices, and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that people throughout the world manage important financial tasks. The result is a global market that is shifting from traditional services that are paper-based, human-produced, and brick-and-mortar bound, to one where people understand, demand, and embrace the benefits of connected services. This trend toward connected services is the primary driver of the strategies in all of our businesses.</P>

Revenue from our QuickBooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters. Sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. In our Consumer Tax business, a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of TurboTax Online, for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return. The seasonality of our Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions. Delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift between our fiscal quarters. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31. During these quarters, revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while core operating expenses such as research and development continue at relatively consistent levels. We believe the seasonality of our revenue and profitability is likely to continue in the future.</P>

Our Small Business Group and our Consumer Tax segment were the key drivers of revenue growth. Revenue in our Small Business Group increased 16% compared with fiscal 2012 due to growth in connected services offerings and our May 2012 acquisition of Demandforce. Revenue in our Consumer Tax segment increased 4% compared with fiscal 2012 due to 4% growth in paid federal units.</P>

Operating expenses were higher due to increases in staffing expenses and, to a lesser extent, to increases in expenses for advertising and other marketing programs and share-based compensation. Net income from continuing operations increased 8% in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 due to higher operating income and lower interest expense. Diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2013 increased 8% to $2.72, in line with the increase in net income compared with fiscal 2012.</P>

In fiscal 2013 we generated cash from operations, from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans, and from the sale of our Intuit Websites business. During the same period we used cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, the payment of cash dividends, net purchases of investment securities, and capital expenditures. At July 31, 2013, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $1.4 billion for stock repurchases through August 15, 2014. On August 19, 2013 our Board approved a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock from time to time over a four-year period ending on August 19, 2017.</P>

We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. For additional information, see ?Revenue Recognition? in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report. We generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves exercising judgment and using estimates that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements containing only software and software-related elements, we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to (1) allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver; (2) determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element; and (4) determine whether and when each element has been delivered. For multiple element arrangements containing non-software elements, we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendor-specific evidence (VSOE) of fair value if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, and estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method. If we were to change any of these judgments or estimates, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.</P>

We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant. The technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment.</P>

Our return policy allows distributors and retailers, subject to contractual limitations, to return purchased products. Product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products. In determining our product returns reserves, we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, historical return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products). We fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels.</P>

Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors? and retailers? actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we typically establish annually.

However, actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain. If we were to change our assumptions and estimates, our revenue reserves would change, which would impact the net revenue we report. If actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established, the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our future reported revenue. For example, if we had increased our fiscal 2013 returns reserves by 1% of non-consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, our total net revenue for fiscal 2013 would have been approximately $3 million lower.</P>

The accounts receivable amounts presented on our balance sheets include reserves for accounts that might not be paid. In determining the amount of these reserves, we consider our historical level of credit losses. We also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. Our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. However, since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established, that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income. Conversely, if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve, this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income. We had a total of $168 million in gross accounts receivable and an allowance for doubtful accounts of $38 million on our balance sheet at July 31, 2013.</P>

Available-for-sale debt securities consist of cash equivalents, municipal bonds, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, corporate notes, and municipal auction rate securities. Available-for-sale equity securities consist of shares of a single publicly traded company. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When identical or similar assets are traded in active markets, the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low. This is generally true for our cash equivalents and our corporate equity securities, which we consider to be Level 1 assets, and our municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities and corporate notes, which we consider to be Level 2 assets. We measure the fair values of our Level 2 investments with the help of a pricing service that either provides quoted market prices in active markets for identical or similar securities or uses observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure that we record appropriate fair values for our Level 2 investments. These controls include comparison to pricing provided by a secondary pricing service or investment manager, validation of pricing sources and models, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period price fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.</P>

For example, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our municipal auction rate securities because we have determined that the market for those securities is inactive. At July 31, 2013, we held a total of $33 million in municipal auction rate securities, which was not significant compared with total available-for-sale debt securities of $860 million at that date.</P>

We consider a number of factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the reason for the decrease in fair value, the severity of the decrease in fair value, the length of time that the fair value has been less than the cost basis of the security, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether we intend to sell or may be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of our cost basis. Changes in our estimates of the fair values of our available-for-sale securities may result in material increases or decreases in our net income in the period in which the change occurs.</P>

We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.</P>

Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets,? in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Report, in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). The income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. We evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and more integrated operations following acquisitions. Although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. When using the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. We base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment. We also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses. We had a total of $1.2 billion in goodwill for continuing operations and $914 million in goodwill for discontinued operations on our balance sheet at July 31, 2013.

The key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows.

As described in Note 1, in step one of that test we compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair values of all of our reporting units except Intuit Health exceeded their carrying values and we concluded that they were not impaired. During this analysis we also concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units except Intuit Health substantially exceeded their carrying values. We completed step two of the test for our Intuit Health reporting unit and determined that the goodwill and acquired intangible assets associated with it were impaired. Consequently, we recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $30 million in fiscal 2011. The market for online patient-to-provider communication solutions is dynamic and competition is intense. Circumstances that negatively affected our estimate of the fair value of our Intuit Health reporting unit included unforeseen delays in developing high quality, timely offerings and marketing them effectively. In March 2013 the largest customer for our Intuit Health business acquired a company that offers similar solutions and competes with us directly in that market space. As a result, we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets during the third quarter of fiscal 2013. We concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill and certain definite-lived acquired intangible assets associated with our Intuit Health business were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $46 million that reduced the carrying value of those assets to zero. See ?Fair Value Measurements - Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis,? in Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for more information. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 management approved a plan to sell our Intuit Health business and we accounted for it as discontinued operations. On August 19, 2013 we completed the sale for cash consideration that was not significant. Intuit Health was part of our Other Businesses reportable segment.</P>

We estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one-year and two-year options on our common stock. Our decision to use implied volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms. In fiscal 2012 we began paying quarterly cash dividends and as a result we began using an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We amortize the fair value of options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. We may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share.</P>

Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied.</P>

Beginning in July 2012, all of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the intrinsic (market) value of our RSUs for dividends.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the United States Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized.

We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable.

The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.</P>

Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends. As discussed in ?Executive Overview ? Industry Trends and Seasonality? earlier in this Item 7, our business is subject to significant seasonality.

We entered into this ASR agreement in order to repurchase shares at a guaranteed discount from the average price of our stock over a specified period of time. On August 23, 2013 we paid $1.4 billion to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of 17.6 million shares of Intuit common stock. The total number of shares to be delivered generally will be determined by applying an agreed discount to the average of the daily volume weighted average price of Intuit common shares traded during the pricing period. The pricing period is scheduled to end in December 2013, but it may conclude sooner at the election of the financial institution. If the total number of shares to be delivered exceeds the number of shares delivered on August 23, 2013, we will receive the remaining balance of shares from the financial institution. Based on the current trading prices of our common stock, we expect to receive additional shares. If the total number of shares to be delivered is less than the number of shares delivered on August 23, 2013, we have the contractual right to deliver to the financial institution either shares of Intuit common stock or cash equal to the value of those shares.</P>

The $449 million included approximately $44 million for the fair value of assumed equity awards that is being charged to expense over service periods of up to four years. Demandforce is a provider of online marketing and customer communication solutions for small businesses and became part of our Financial Management Solutions segment. We have included the results of operations for Demandforce in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Their results of operations for periods prior to the date of acquisition were not material when compared with our consolidated results of operations.

We repaid the 2012 Notes when they became due using cash from operations. The 2017 Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15. At July 31, 2013, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the 2017 Notes was $115 million.

See Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for a description of the key terms of this agreement, including the covenants. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended July 31, 2013. We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions. To date we have not borrowed under the credit facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility. We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.</P>

    <P id="150" negativepercentage="0.0" negativetotal="0" negativewords="NONE" pID="151" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> Our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.7 billion at July 31, 2013. Of this amount, approximately 10% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations. These foreign funds were located primarily in Canada, and to a lesser extent in India, Singapore, and the UK. We intend to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and we currently do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event that funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States, if U.S. taxes have not been previously provided on the related earnings we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes at the time we change our intention with regard to the reinvestment of those earnings.</P>

This period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets has exposed us to investment risks beyond those typically inherent in investment securities. The value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of these securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades. In light of the current market conditions and these additional risks, we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control.</P>
    <P id="154" negativepercentage="0.0" negativetotal="0" negativewords="NONE" pID="155" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> Our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. We do not hold derivative financial instruments or European sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments. See Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue.</P>

The table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents, which consist primarily of money market funds. At July 31, 2013, the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 0.03% and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 0.37%.</P>
    <P id="156" negativepercentage="0.0" negativetotal="0" negativewords="NONE" pID="157" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> Our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 25 basis points from the level of July 31, 2013, the value of our investments would decrease by approximately $3 million. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2013, the value of our investments would decrease by approximately $10 million.</P>

Advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to JP Morgan's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%, in both cases based on our senior debt ratings. Consequently, our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility. At July 31, 2013, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility.</P>
    <P id="158" negativepercentage="0.0" negativetotal="0" negativewords="NONE" pID="159" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> On March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017. We carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets. Since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 2 and Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for more information.</P>

The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2013, we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities.</P>
