We offer comprehensive product lines in the areas of medication management, infection prevention, operation room (?OR?) effectiveness, respiratory care and surveillance and analytics. Our offerings include established brands used in hospitals throughout the United States and more than 130 countries worldwide.

For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, we generated revenue of $3.6 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. We generated income from continuing operations of $361 million in fiscal year 2012 and $299 million in fiscal year 2011. Approximately 22% of our fiscal year 2012 revenue was from customers outside of the United States.</P>

    <P id="8" negativepercentage="0.0" negativetotal="0" negativewords="NONE" pID="9" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> We were incorporated in Delaware on January 14, 2009 for the purpose of holding Cardinal Health, Inc.?s clinical and medical products businesses in anticipation of the spinoff from Cardinal Health. We completed the spinoff from Cardinal Health on August 31, 2009. In connection with the spinoff, Cardinal Health contributed the majority of the businesses comprising its clinical and medical products segment to us and distributed approximately 81% of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 179.8 million shares, to its shareholders. Cardinal Health retained approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 41.4 million shares, in connection with the spinoff. As of September 15, 2010, Cardinal Health had sold all remaining shares of our common stock retained in connection with the spinoff.</P>
    <P id="9" negativepercentage="0.0" negativetotal="0" negativewords="NONE" pID="10" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> We have incurred one-time expenditures in connection with the separation from Cardinal Health (capital and expense), primarily associated with employee-related costs, costs to start up certain stand-alone functions and information technology systems and other one-time transaction related costs. In fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 we incurred approximately $3 million, $80 million, and $120 million, respectively, of these one-time expenditures. We have funded these costs through cash from operations and cash on hand. The capital portion of these expenditures is amortized over their useful lives and the other expenditures are expensed as incurred, depending on their nature. We now believe that all substantive expenditures associated with standing up operations from the spinoff are complete.</P>
    <P id="10" negativepercentage="0.0" negativetotal="0" negativewords="NONE" pID="11" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> Additionally, we have incurred increased costs as an independent, publicly-traded company, primarily as a result of higher charges than in the past from Cardinal Health for transition services and from establishing or expanding the corporate support for our businesses, including information technology, human resources, treasury, tax, risk management, accounting and financial reporting, investor relations, legal, procurement and other services. We believe cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these additional corporate expenses going forward.</P>

However, some of our businesses rely on capital spending from our customers (primarily hospitals), which can be influenced by a variety of economic factors, including interest rates, access to financing and endowment fluctuations. Significant changes in these economic factors can affect the sales of our capital equipment products, such as infusion pumps, dispensing equipment and ventilators. Additionally, sales volumes for some of our businesses are dependent on hospital admissions. Changes in admissions due to difficult economic times can affect our results for surgical and single-use products, such as infusion and respiratory disposable sets, surgical instruments and skin antiseptic products.</P>

Despite seeing small signs of improvement in overall hospital capital spending, we continue to anticipate it will take some time before significant market improvements are realized and that prioritization will continue to be a significant factor as hospitals focus on attaining meaningful use capabilities within their information technology systems. We continue to believe that our Medical Systems business lines are well positioned to benefit from increases in hospital capital equipment spending as the market recovers over time.</P>

Procedural volumes in acute care facilities represent one indicator for the demand of the disposable products sold within our Procedural Solutions operating segment. In addition to procedural volumes, demand for many of our Procedural Solutions products is created when physicians convert their existing practices away from legacy methods and adopt our clinically differentiated products. As a result, we believe our clinically differentiated product revenue has consistently outperformed trends in acute care facility procedural volumes.</P>

In March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform was enacted in the United States through the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Acts. Among other initiatives, the legislation provides for a 2.3% annual excise tax on the sales of certain medical devices in the United States, commencing in January 2013. We will record this excise tax as a selling, general and administrative expense, which will have an adverse affect on our operating expenses and results of operations. We currently expect the impact of the tax to be approximately $15 million to $20 million in our fiscal year 2013, rising to approximately $30 million to $40 million annually thereafter. In addition, as the United States federal government implements additional provisions of healthcare reform, we anticipate that Congress, regulatory agencies and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access. The uncertainties regarding the implementation and impact of the enacted healthcare reform measures, as well as other potential reform initiatives in the future, may have an adverse effect on our customers? purchasing decisions regarding our products and services.</P>

This program, announced in August 2010 (the ?2011 Plan?), was designed to reduce our cost structure and streamline operations, and was initially expected to result in a reduction of approximately 700 positions. The 2011 Plan resulted in a reduction of approximately 850 positions in fiscal 2011. This program provided operating expense savings of approximately $103 million in fiscal year 2011, primarily as a result of reducing headcount and eliminating unfilled positions. Of the $103 million of savings, approximately $65 million was a result of year over year savings in selling, general and administrative expense (?SG&amp;A?) and lower cost of sales expense, and $38 million was a result of not filling open positions. The total expected restructuring costs associated with the 2011 Plan are approximately $50 million. Substantially all of the costs associated with the 2011 Plan were incurred as of June 30, 2011.</P>

Our investment expense in research and development during fiscal year 2012 was $164 million, or 5% of revenues. Looking forward, we remain committed to producing a pipeline of innovative products to continue to support our growth strategies. We plan to increase our research and development expenditures with internal initiatives, as well as licensing or acquiring technology from third parties. Our internal and external investments will be focused on initiatives that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. With a significant investment in research and development, a strong focus on innovation and a well-managed innovation process, we believe we can continue to innovate and grow. If, however, our future innovations are not successful in meeting customers? needs or prove to be too costly versus their perceived benefit, our growth may slow.</P>

Due to the global nature of our business, our revenue and expenses are influenced by foreign exchange movements. In fiscal year 2012, approximately 16% of our sales were in currencies other than the United States dollar. Increases or decreases in the value of the United States dollar compared to other currencies will affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into United States dollars.

Our business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions by Cardinal Health of established healthcare companies, including the acquisition in 2007 of VIASYS Healthcare Inc. (?Viasys?), a developer of respiratory care systems, and the acquisition in 2008 of the assets of Enturia, Inc. (?Enturia?), a manufacturer of skin-antiseptic products. Since our separation from Cardinal Health, we have taken steps to expand and refine our product offerings, including through the acquisitions and divestitures described below.</P>

The value of this IPR&amp;D was calculated based on a discounted cash flow method, which involved a number of significant assumptions, including timing of product deployment, revenues, margin, and associated discount rates. Effective July 1, 2009, IPR&amp;D associated with business combinations is initially recorded in the balance sheet at fair value and tested for impairment annually until it is put into service. Prior to July 1, 2009, all acquired IPR&amp;D was expensed immediately. See note 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements.</P>

A quality or safety issue may result in public warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant clearances or approvals or delays in granting such clearances or approvals, import detentions of products made outside the United States, restrictions on operations or withdrawal or suspension of existing approvals. Any of the foregoing events could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, recalls may negatively affect sales due to customer concerns about product quality. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, net charges related to product recalls were $23 million. For fiscal year 2011, net charges related to product recalls were not material. For fiscal year 2010, net charges related to product recalls were $3 million.</P>

We entered into a consent decree with the FDA in February 2007 related to our Alaris SE pumps, and in February 2009, we and the FDA amended the consent decree (?amended consent decree?) to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for CareFusion 303, Inc., our subsidiary that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the United States. The amended consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories.</P>

In accordance with the consent decree, we reconditioned Alaris SE pumps that had been seized by the FDA, remediated Alaris SE pumps in use by customers, and had an independent expert inspect the Alaris SE pump facilities and provide a certification to the FDA as to compliance. As result of these efforts, in January 2010, we announced that the FDA had given us permission to resume the manufacturing and marketing of our Alaris SE pumps. In accordance with the amended consent decree, and in addition to the requirements of the original consent decree, we also implemented a corrective action plan to bring the Alaris System and all other infusion pumps in use in the United States market into compliance, had our infusion pump facilities inspected by an independent expert, and had our recall procedures and all ongoing recalls involving our infusion pumps inspected by an independent recall expert. In July 2010, the FDA notified us that we can proceed to the audit inspection phase of the amended consent decree, which includes the requirement to retain an independent expert to conduct periodic audits of our infusion pump facilities. The amended consent decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing, recall products and take other actions. We may be required to pay damages of $15,000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree, up to $15 million per year.</P>

As of June 30, 2012, we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the amended consent decree, and accordingly, we have no reserves to cover any possible future costs and expenses of compliance with the amended consent decree. As such, we may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because, among other things, the FDA may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree, and/or we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree.</P>

For several months of fiscal year 2009, we placed a hold on shipping the Alaris System while we sought FDA clearance for a software correction. We received the required clearance in July 2009, and we subsequently resumed shipments. This shipping hold resulted in a negative impact on our infusion revenues in fiscal year 2009. When we released the shipping hold in July 2009, we saw higher demand, which resulted in higher revenues for fiscal year 2010.</P>

During fiscal year 2011, three of our competitors recalled their infusion pumps to correct safety concerns. In addition, a fourth was ordered by the FDA to recall and destroy as many as 200,000 of its infusion pumps and to provide refunds to its customers or replace pumps at no cost. As a result, there was increased demand for infusion pumps in the United States in fiscal year 2011 and 2012, as healthcare providers sought to replace or upgrade their existing equipment. We experienced increased demand for our infusion pumps as a result, which contributed to higher infusion revenues for fiscal year 2011 and 2012. In order to successfully compete in this business environment, we temporarily discounted the pricing on our infusion pumps, in some cases up to 30% or more. We believe that sales related to this opportunity are substantially complete as of June 30, 2012.</P>

At June 30, 2011, accrued employee incentive compensation balances were significantly lower than similar accruals at June 30, 2010. Additionally, there was a decrease in cash flow associated with accounts receivable as a result of temporary delays in collections as a result of new system implementations of $149 million and a decrease in cash flow associated with inventory of $97 million. These decreases in operating cash flow were partially offset by increases in income from continuing operations of $138 million and the impact of non-cash items of $180 million, primarily attributable to changes in deferred income taxes.</P>

The value of our products is driven principally by their technological features and is subject to obsolescence due to advancements in technological features of next generation models. We consider the economic life of our technology-dependent capital equipment products to be five years based on the anticipated future technological advances of our products or that of our competitors. Additionally, five years represents the most frequent contractual lease term for our technology-dependent principal products and virtually none of our leases are for original terms longer than five years. Our product configurations are customized for each customer?s specific specifications, and there is no significant after-market for our used equipment and the equipment is not re-leased upon return. Upon return of the leased products, they are broken down and certain parts are reclaimed, but most of the parts are scrapped or discarded. Thus, we believe five years is representative of the period during which the technology-dependent products are expected to be economically usable at the inception of the lease.

We stratify our cash selling prices of similar products by similar classes of customers based upon GPO or IDN affiliation. We believe the characteristics of the GPO or IDN, including size, volume, pre-negotiated trade discounts, and preferred provider relationship, is an appropriate basis to stratify our customer classes and related transacted cash sales to establish the normal selling price reflective of any volume or trade discounts for that class of customer. The interest rate implicit to the sales-type lease is used to determine the amount of revenue recognized at the inception of the lease and is derived as the interest rate which causes the fair value of the equipment to equal the present value of the minimum lease payments and the present value of the leased asset?s residual value.</P>

Management?s best estimate of selling price is developed consistent with the price at which we would transact if the deliverable were sold by the vendor regularly on a stand-alone basis.

In connection with certain acquisitions, we are required to estimate the fair value of acquired IPR&amp;D, which requires selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project. Management also assesses the current status of development, nature and timing of efforts to complete such development, uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value. Costs are not assigned to IPR&amp;D unless future development is probable. Beginning with acquisitions completed on or after July 1, 2009, IPR&amp;D is recorded as an unamortized intangible asset until the underlying products are either completed and put into service, which would require commencing amortization over the estimated product life, or determining the products will not complete development, which would require impairing the portion of IPR&amp;D associated with that product. Until either determination is made, IPR&amp;D is subject to periodic impairment review, with impairments, if any, expensed to our consolidated statement of income. During fiscal year 2010, we completed the acquisition of Medegen, which resulted in approximately $45 million of IPR&amp;D associated with new products under development being recorded as an intangible asset.

There are no fluid active or inactive markets for our operating segments to derive approximate fair values, and accordingly, the valuation process is similar to the valuation of a closely-held company and considers valuation methods that are income-based and market-based. Our income-based approach is a discounted cash flow method which utilizes an estimated discount rate to the projected after-tax cash flows for the operating segment. Our market-based approach utilizes an estimated market-based multiple to the operating segments? estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (?EBITDA?). The results of the income-based and market-based approaches are equally weighted to arrive at the total estimated fair value for each operating segment.
