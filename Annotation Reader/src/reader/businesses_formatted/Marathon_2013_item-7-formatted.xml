Marathon stockholders at the close of business on the record date of June 27, 2011 received one share of MPC common stock for every two shares of Marathon common stock held. A private letter tax ruling received in June 2011 from the IRS affirmed the tax-free nature of the spin-off. Activities related to the downstream business have been treated as discontinued operations in 2011 and 2010 (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ? Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information).</P>
    <P id="8" negativepercentage="0.0" negativetotal="0" negativewords="NONE" pID="9" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> Prevailing prices for the various grades of crude oil and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. The following table lists benchmark crude oil and natural gas price annual averages for the past three years.</P>

Prices of crude oil have been volatile in recent years, but less so when comparing annual averages for 2012 and 2011. In 2011, crude prices increased over 2010 levels, with increases in Brent averages outstripping those in WTI.</P>
    <P id="10" negativepercentage="0.004761904761904762" negativetotal="1" negativewords="COSTLY" pID="11" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> The quality, location and composition of our liquid hydrocarbon production mix will cause our U.S. liquid hydrocarbon realizations to differ from the WTI benchmark. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the percentage of our U.S. crude oil and condensate production that was sour averaged 37 percent, 58 percent and 68 percent. Sour crude contains more sulfur and tends to be heavier than light sweet crude oil so that refining it is more costly and produces lower value products; therefore, sour crude is considered of lower quality and typically sells at a discount to WTI. The percentage of our U.S. crude and condensate production that is sour has been decreasing as onshore production from the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale plays increases and production from the Gulf of Mexico declines. In recent years, crude oil sold along the U.S. Gulf Coast has been priced at a premium to WTI because the Louisiana Light Sweet benchmark has been tracking Brent, while production from inland areas farther from large refineries has been at a discount to WTI. NGLs were 10 percent, 7 percent and 6 percent of our U.S. liquid hydrocarbon sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010. In 2012, our sales of NGLs increased due to our development of U.S. unconventional liquids-rich plays.</P>
    <P id="11" negativepercentage="0.0" negativetotal="0" negativewords="NONE" pID="12" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> Our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. The differential between WTI and Brent average prices widened significantly in 2011 and remained in 2012 in comparison to almost no differential in 2010.</P>
    <P id="12" negativepercentage="0.025" negativetotal="2" negativewords="DECLINE,LATE" pID="13" positivepercentage="0.0125" positivetotal="1" positivewords="STABILIZED"> Natural gas ? A significant portion of our natural gas production in the lower 48 states of the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. Average Henry Hub settlement prices for natural gas were lower in 2012 than in recent years. A decline in average settlement date Henry Hub natural gas prices began in September 2011 and continued into 2012. Although prices stabilized in late 2012, they have not increased appreciably.  </P>
    <P id="13" negativepercentage="0.0" negativetotal="0" negativewords="NONE" pID="14" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> Our other major natural gas-producing regions are E.G. and Europe. In the case of E.G,. our natural gas sales are subject to term contracts, making realizations less volatile. Because natural gas sales from E.G. are at fixed prices, our worldwide reported average natural gas realizations may not fully track market price movements. Natural gas prices in Europe have been significantly higher than in the U.S.</P>

Output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mines or upgrader. Sales prices for roughly two-thirds of the normal output mix will track movements in WTI and one-third will track movements in the Canadian heavy sour crude oil marker, primarily WCS. In 2012, the WCS discount from WTI had increased, putting downward pressure on our average realizations.  </P>
    <P id="15" negativepercentage="0.0" negativetotal="0" negativewords="NONE" pID="16" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> The operating cost structure of the OSM operations is predominantly fixed and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. Per-unit costs are sensitive to production rates. Key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel, which track commodity markets such as the Canadian Alberta Energy Company ("AECO") natural gas sales index and crude oil prices, respectively.</P>
    <P id="16" negativepercentage="0.0" negativetotal="0" negativewords="NONE" pID="17" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> Our IG operations include production and marketing of products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.</P>
    <P id="17" negativepercentage="0.0" negativetotal="0" negativewords="NONE" pID="18" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> World LNG trade in 2012 has been estimated to be 240 mmt. Long-term, LNG continues to be in demand as markets seek the benefits of clean burning natural gas. Market prices for LNG are not reported or posted. In general, LNG delivered to the U.S. is tied to Henry Hub prices and will track with changes in U.S. natural gas prices, while LNG sold in Europe and Asia is indexed to crude oil prices and will track the movement of those prices. We have a 60 percent ownership in an LNG production facility in E.G., which sells LNG under a long-term contract at prices tied to Henry Hub natural gas prices. Gross sales from the plant were 3.8 mmt, 4.1 mmt and 3.7 mmt in 2012, 2011 and 2010.</P>
    <P id="18" negativepercentage="0.0" negativetotal="0" negativewords="NONE" pID="19" positivepercentage="0.0" positivetotal="0" positivewords="NONE"> We own a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in E.G. through our investment in AMPCO. Gross sales of methanol from the plant totaled 1.1 mmt, 1.0 mmt and 0.9 mmt in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Methanol demand has a direct impact on AMPCO?s earnings. Because global demand for methanol is rather limited, changes in the supply-demand balance can have a significant impact on sales prices. World demand for methanol in 2012 has been estimated to be 49 mmt. Our plant capacity of 1.1 mmt is about 2 percent of world demand.</P>

The 7 percent decrease in income from continuing operations included lower earnings in the U.K. and E.G., partially offset by higher earnings in Libya. Also, in 2011 we were not in an excess foreign tax credit position for the entire year as we were in 2012.

See the Cost of revenues discussion as revenues from supply optimization approximate the related costs. Supply optimization serves to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points.

Comparatively, costs related to supply optimization were lower by $1,152 million for 2012, primarily due to lower volumes in 2012 due to market dynamics. The related commodity prices were also slightly lower in 2012. Excluding the impact of supply optimization activities, E&amp;P segment operating expenses have increased in proportion to our increased production from U.S. shale plays. Additionally, IG segment costs are lower in 2012 due to the sale of our interest in the Alaska LNG facility in the third quarter of 2011.</P>

Since both our E&amp;P and OSM segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, the previously discussed increases in sales volumes generally result in similar changes in DD&amp;A. Increased DD&amp;A in 2012 primarily reflects the impact of higher sales volumes.  There was no depletion of our Alaska assets for much of 2012 because they were held for sale, which partially offset the DD&amp;A increase.  The DD&amp;A rate (expense per barrel of oil equivalent), which is impacted by changes in proved reserves and capitalized costs, can also cause changes in our DD&amp;A. Our E&amp;P segment's DD&amp;A rates have decreased slightly since 2011 primarily due to proved reserve additions. The following table provides DD&amp;A rates for our E&amp;P and OSM segments.</P>

The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost.

This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from AA bond yields. The yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used are rated AA or higher by a recognized rating agency, only non-callable bonds are included and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed.
