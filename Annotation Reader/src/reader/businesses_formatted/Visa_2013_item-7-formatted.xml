We provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products, including credit, debit and prepaid. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide.</P>

On October 19, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims in the interchange multidistrict litigation. The court entered the preliminary approval order of the settlement agreement on November 27, 2012. On December 10, 2012, Visa paid approximately $4.0 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement. Certain merchants in the proposed settlement classes, however, have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed opt-out claims. Until the settlement agreement is finally approved by the court and any appeals are finally adjudicated, no assurance can be provided that Visa will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs? claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement. We also signed a settlement agreement to resolve the claims brought by a group of individual merchants which were consolidated with the interchange multidistrict litigation for coordination of pre-trial proceedings. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, we paid $350 million from the litigation escrow account to the individual merchants on October 29, 2012, and on November 6, 2012, the court entered an order dismissing the individual merchants' claims with prejudice.

Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Compared to the prior year, overall payments volume grew in all categories worldwide except U.S. consumer debit, which has been negatively impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act beginning April 1, 2012.

We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate.

Operating revenue growth also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services. These benefits were partially offset by volume loss and increases to client incentives implemented in the United States during the second half of fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act.</P>

The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2013, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an overall decline of about one percentage point in total operating revenue growth compared to fiscal 2012. While we expect our hedging program to continue to mitigate this risk during fiscal 2014, a general strengthening of the U.S. dollar is expected to reduce total operating revenue growth by about two percentage points for fiscal 2014, net of offsetting hedges.

The growth in service revenues in fiscal 2012 was greater than the growth in nominal payments volume due to a shift in the mix of our payments volume, primarily in volume related to Interlink, which is a debit product that does not generate any service revenues.</P>

These included a number of significant long-term merchant and acquirer contracts executed as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as issuer contracts executed in fiscal 2013. Additionally, client incentives increased as a result of overall growth in global payments volume. Activity in fiscal 2012 also reflects certain one-time incentives incurred outside the United States. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5% for the full 2014 fiscal year.</P>

The increase in fiscal 2012 is primarily due to increases in headcount, and reflects annualized costs from our acquisitions of PlaySpan and Fundamo in March 2011 and June 2011, respectively.</P>

Under the settlement agreement, if class members opt out of the damages portion of the class settlement, defendants are entitled to receive takedown payments of no more than 25% of the original cash payments made into the settlement fund, based on the percentage of payment card sales volume for a defined period attributable to merchants who opted out.

The $100 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2013, or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $100 million demonstrated at the time of exercise.

In fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $4 million, $88 million, and $74 million, respectively. The lower contribution in fiscal 2013 was driven by a higher-than-expected rate of return on our plan assets during the year and an increase in the discount rate at September 30, 2013 compared to September 30, 2012.

We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance.

We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings.</P>

For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the ?long-term P/E calculation?) and the last 30 trading dates (the ?30-day P/E calculation?) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System. We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weigh long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators.</P>

A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market's expectations of our future earnings and those of comparable companies.</P>

The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europe's current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of its exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weigh these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe's results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value.</P>

In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2013, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2013. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management's expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months.</P>

We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows.
