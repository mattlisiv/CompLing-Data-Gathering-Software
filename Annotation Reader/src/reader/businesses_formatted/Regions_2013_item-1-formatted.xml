The Federal Reserve and the Alabama Banking Department regularly examine the operations of Regions Bank and are given authority to approve or disapprove mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. The federal and state banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Regions Bank is subject to numerous statutes and regulations that affect its business activities and operations, including various consumer protection laws and regulations.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ?Dodd-Frank Act?), which was enacted in July 2010, significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime in the United States and provides for enhanced supervision and prudential standards for, among other things, bank holding companies like Regions that have total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The implications of the Dodd-Frank Act for our business will depend to a large extent on the manner in which rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act are implemented by the Federal Reserve, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the FDIC, the SEC, and other government agencies, as well as potential changes in market practices and structures in response to the requirements of those rules.</P>

The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new systemic risk oversight body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (?FSOC?) to coordinate the efforts of the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies (including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the SEC) in establishing regulations to address systemic financial stability concerns. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FSOC to make recommendations to the Federal Reserve regarding supervisory requirements and prudential standards applicable to systemically important financial institutions (often referred to as ?SIFI,? which includes bank holding companies with over $50 billion in assets, such as Regions), including capital, leverage, liquidity and risk-management requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that the requirements applicable to systemically important financial institutions be more stringent than those applicable to other financial companies. The Federal Reserve has discretionary authority to establish additional prudential standards, on its own or at the FSOC?s recommendation. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the Federal Reserve to conduct annual analyses of such bank holding companies to evaluate whether the companies have sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions.</P>

In December 2011, the Federal Reserve introduced a new proposal aimed at minimizing risks associated with ?covered companies,? including U.S. bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and other financial companies designated by the FSOC as systemically important (?Proposed SIFI Rules?). The Federal Reserve?s proposal includes risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity requirements, stress tests, single-counterparty credit limits and overall risk management requirements, early remediation requirements and resolution planning and credit exposure reporting. The proposed rules would address a wide, diverse array of regulatory areas, each of which is highly complex. In some cases they would implement financial regulatory requirements being proposed for the first time, and in others overlap with other regulatory reforms. The proposed rules also address the Dodd-Frank Act?s early remediation requirements applicable to bank holding companies that have total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The proposed remediation rules are modeled after the prompt corrective action regime, described under ??Safety and Soundness Standards? below, but are designed to require action beginning in the earlier stages of a company?s financial distress by mandating action on the basis of arranged triggers, including capital and leverage, stress test results, liquidity, and risk management. Except as described in the second paragraph under ?Federal Reserve?s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review? below regarding stress testing, the Proposed SIFI Rules have not become final as of February 2013. The full impact of the Proposed SIFI Rules on Regions is being analyzed, but will not be known until the rules, and other regulatory initiatives that overlap with these rules, are finalized and their combined impacts can be understood.</P>

In November 2011, the Federal Reserve published a final rule which requires U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more (such as Regions) to submit annual capital plans, along with related stress test requirements, to the Federal Reserve for approval. The capital analysis and review process provided for in the rule is known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (?CCAR?). The purpose of the capital plan is to ensure that these bank holding companies have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for each company?s unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. The capital plans are required to be submitted on an annual basis. Such bank holding companies will also be required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the Federal Reserve to monitor the companies? progress against their annual capital plans. The comprehensive capital plans, which Regions prepares using Basel I capital guidelines, include a view of capital adequacy under the stress test scenarios described below. The effect of the rules is that, among other things, a covered bank holding company may not make a capital distribution unless it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios and will have a ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets of at least 5% after making the distribution. The rules also provide that the Federal Reserve may object to a capital plan if the plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will maintain a Tier 1 common equity ratio of at least 5% on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the nine-quarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan. Covered bank holding companies, including Regions, may execute capital actions such as paying dividends and repurchasing stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the Federal Reserve. The CCAR rules, consistent with prior Federal Reserve guidance, provide that capital plans contemplating dividend payout ratios exceeding 30% of after-tax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny.</P>

In October 2012, the Federal Reserve published final rules implementing that portion of the Proposed SIFI Rules expanding the stress testing requirements. Also, we are required to conduct our own semi-annual stress analysis (together with the Federal Reserve?s stress analysis, the ?Stress Tests?) to assess the potential impact on Regions, including our consolidated earnings, losses and capital, under each of the economic and financial conditions used as part of the Federal Reserve?s annual stress analysis. The Federal Reserve may also use, and require companies to use, additional components in the adverse and severely adverse scenarios or additional or more complex scenarios designed to capture salient risks to specific lines of business. Regions Bank is also required by final Federal Reserve rules to conduct annual stress testing and report the results to the Federal Reserve. Under the Federal Reserve?s guidance, the CCAR annual process for 2013 will be implemented in conjunction with the stress testing requirements described above. A summary of results of the Federal Reserve?s analysis under the severely adverse stress scenario will be publicly disclosed, and the bank holding companies subject to the rules, including Regions, must disclose a summary of the company-run severely adverse stress test results. Regions is required to include in its disclosure a summary of the severely adverse scenario stress test conducted by Regions Bank using the scenarios defined by the Federal Reserve. Regions submitted its 2013 CCAR rule capital plan to the Federal Reserve on January 7, 2013 and the Federal Reserve committed to responding by March 14, 2013.</P>

Regions? resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that our depository institution subsidiary is adequately protected from risks arising from our other subsidiaries.

The rule requires these insured institutions to submit a resolution plan that will enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the bank in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution?s failure, maximizes the net-present-value return from the sale or disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution?s creditors. The final rule also sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan?s components, a description of the strategies for achieving the least costly resolution, and analyses of the financial company?s organization, material entities, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements.

The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the ?CFPB?), a new consumer financial services regulator. The CFPB is directed to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices and ensure that all consumers have access to fair, transparent, and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to enforce and issue rules and regulations implementing existing consumer protection laws and responsibility for all such existing regulations. Depository institutions with assets exceeding $10 billion, such as Regions Bank, their affiliates, and other ?larger participants? in the markets for consumer financial services (as determined by the CFPB) are subject to direct supervision by the CFPB, including any applicable examination, enforcement and reporting requirements the CFPB may establish. Orderly Liquidation Authority.    The Dodd-Frank Act creates the Orderly Liquidation Authority (?OLA?), a resolution regime for systemically important non-bank financial companies and their non-bank affiliates, including bank holding companies, under which the FDIC may be appointed receiver to liquidate such a company if, among other conditions, the company is in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. This determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC and consultation between the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury and the President. This resolution authority is generally based on the FDIC resolution model for depository institutions, and substantial differences exist between the rights of creditors under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and in an orderly liquidation authority proceeding including the ability of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors? claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the ability of the FDIC to transfer claims to a ?bridge? entity. In addition, OLA limits the ability of creditors to enforce contractual cross-defaults against potentially viable affiliates of the institution in receivership.</P>

Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, both in the U.S. and internationally, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III final framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward will be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (?LCR?), is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity?s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25 percent of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (?NSFR?), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements will incentivize banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. The Basel III liquidity framework contemplates that the LCR will be subject to an observation period continuing through mid-2013 and subject to any revisions resulting from the analyses conducted and data collected during the observation period, implemented as a minimum standard on January 1, 2015. Similarly, it contemplates that the NSFR will be subject to an observation period through mid-2016 and, subject to any revisions resulting from the analyses conducted and data collected during the observation period, implemented as a minimum standard by January 1, 2018. In January 2013, the Basel Committee issued amendments to the LCR that, among other things, includes an easing of the phase-in period. Institutions must be in 60% compliance with the minimum LCR as of January 1, 2015 (rather than 100% compliance as originally contemplated), increasing 10% each year thereafter with 100% compliance required as of January 1, 2019.

Although these rules do not include prescriptive ratios like the LCR and NSFR, they do include detailed liquidity-related requirements, including requirements for cash flow projections, liquidity stress testing (including, at a minimum, over time horizons that include an overnight time horizon, a 30-day time horizon, a 90-day time horizon and a 1-year time horizon), and a requirement that covered bank holding companies maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets sufficient to meet projected net cash outflows and the projected loss or impairment of existing funding sources for 30 days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios.

In general, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W require that any ?covered transaction? by Regions Bank (or its subsidiaries) with an affiliate that is an extension of credit must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited to (a) in the case of any single such affiliate, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of Regions Bank and its subsidiaries may not exceed 10 percent of the capital stock and surplus of Regions Bank, and (b) in the case of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of Regions Bank and its subsidiaries may not exceed 20 percent of the capital stock and surplus of Regions Bank. ?Covered transactions? are defined by statute to include, among other things, a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization. For example, commencing in July 2012, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that the 10% of capital limit on covered transactions begin to apply to financial subsidiaries. Commencing in July 2012, Dodd-Frank also expands the definition of a ?covered transaction? to include derivatives transactions and securities lending transactions with a non-bank affiliate under which a bank (or a subsidiary) has credit exposure (with the term ?credit exposure? to be defined by the Federal Reserve under its existing rulemaking authority). Collateral requirements will apply to such transactions as well as to certain repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. All covered transactions, including certain additional transactions (such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest), must be conducted on market terms. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects to request comment on a proposed rule in 2013 regarding the Dodd-Frank revisions to Sections 23A and 23B.</P>

Regions Bank pays deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC based on an assessment rate established by the FDIC. Regions? FDIC assessment rates were previously calculated based upon a combination of regulatory ratings and financial ratios. However, in February 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule (the ?New Assessment Rule?), which took effect on April 1, 2011, to revise the deposit insurance assessment system for large institutions. The New Assessment Rule creates a two scorecard system for large institutions, one for most large institutions that have more than $10 billion in assets, such as Regions Bank, and another for ?highly complex? institutions that have over $50 billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over $500 billion in assets. Each scorecard has a performance score and a loss-severity score that are combined to produce a total score, which is translated into an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC utilizes the bank?s supervisory (?CAMELS?) ratings as well as forward-looking financial measures to assess an institution?s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score, up or down, based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard. The total score is then translated to an initial base assessment rate on a non-linear, sharply-increasing scale. For large institutions, including Regions Bank, the initial base assessment rate ranges from 5 to 35 basis points on an annualized basis (basis points representing cents per $100). After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range from 2.5 to 45 basis points on an annualized basis. The potential adjustments to an institution?s initial base assessment rate include (i) a potential decrease of up to 5 basis points for certain long-term unsecured debt (?unsecured debt adjustment?) and (ii) (except for well-capitalized institutions with a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2) a potential increase of up to 10 basis points for brokered deposits in excess of 10% of domestic deposits (?brokered deposit adjustment?). As the DIF reserve ratio grows, the rate schedule will be adjusted downward. Additionally, the rule includes a new adjustment for depository institution debt whereby an institution will pay an additional premium equal to 50 basis points on every dollar (above 3% of an institution?s Tier 1 capital) of long-term, unsecured debt held that was issued by another insured depository institution, excluding debt guaranteed under the FDIC?s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). The New Assessment Rule also changed the deposit insurance assessment base from deposits to the average of consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period.</P>

On December 20, 2010, the FDIC issued a final rule setting the DRR at 2 percent. Because the DRR fell below 1.15 percent as of June 30, 2008, and was expected to remain below 1.15 percent, the FDIC was required to establish and implement a restoration plan that would restore the reserve ratio to at least 1.15 percent within five years. In October 2008, the FDIC adopted such a restoration plan (the ?Restoration Plan?). In February 2009, in light of the extraordinary challenges facing the banking industry, the FDIC amended the Restoration Plan to allow seven years for the reserve ratio to return to 1.15 percent. In October 2009, the FDIC passed a final rule extending the term of the Restoration Plan to eight years. This final rule also included a provision that implements a uniform three basis point increase in assessment rates, effective January 1, 2011, to help ensure that the reserve ratio returns to at least 1.15 percent within the eight year period called for by the Restoration Plan. In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new restoration plan to ensure the DRR reaches 1.35 percent by September 2020. As part of the revised plan, the FDIC did not implement the uniform three-basis point increase in assessment rates that was scheduled to take place in January 2011. The FDIC will, at least semi-annually, update its income and loss projections for the DIF and, if necessary, propose rules to further increase assessment rates. In addition, on January 12, 2010, the FDIC announced that it would seek public comment on whether banks with compensation plans that encourage risky behavior should be charged higher deposit assessment rates than such banks would otherwise be charged. Comments were due February 18, 2010. As of February 2013, no rule has been adopted. See also ??Incentive Compensation? below.</P>

Although the general business environment has shown some improvement, there can be no assurance that it will continue to improve. Additionally, the improvement of certain economic indicators, such as real estate asset values and rents and unemployment, may vary between geographic markets and may continue to lag behind improvement in the overall economy. These economic indicators typically affect certain industries, such as real estate and financial services, more significantly than other economic sectors. For example, improvements in commercial real estate fundamentals typically lag broad economic recovery by twelve to eighteen months. Our clients include entities active in the real estate and financial services industries. Furthermore, financial services companies with a substantial lending business, like ours, are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make debt service payments on loans. If economic conditions worsen or remain volatile, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Concerns about the European Union?s sovereign debt and the future of the euro have also caused uncertainty for financial markets globally. Such risks could indirectly affect us by affecting our hedging or other counterparties, as well as our customers with European businesses or assets denominated in the euro or companies in our markets with European businesses or affiliates.</P>

The borrower?s ability to repay the loan is instead dependent upon additional leasing through the life of the loan or the borrower?s successful operation of a business. Weak economic conditions may impair a borrower?s business operations and typically slow the execution of new leases. Such economic conditions may also lead to existing lease turnover. As a result of these factors, vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space may remain at elevated levels in 2013. High vacancy rates could result in rents falling further over the next several quarters.

Of our $11.8 billion home equity portfolio at December 31, 2012, approximately $10.4 billion were home equity lines of credit and $1.4 billion were closed-end home equity loans (primarily originated as amortizing loans). This type of lending, which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower?s residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home. Real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended, and, in addition, past and future changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses. Second lien position lending carries higher credit risk because any decrease in real estate pricing may result in the value of the collateral being insufficient to cover the second lien after the first lien position has been satisfied. We have realized higher levels of charge-offs on second lien positions, particularly in the state of Florida, where real estate valuations have been depressed over the past several years.

Short sale offers and settlement agreements are often received by the home equity junior lien holders well before the loan balance reaches the delinquency threshold for charge-off consideration, potentially resulting in a full balance payoff/charge-off. We are presently monitoring the status of all first lien position loans that we own or service and also own a second lien, and we are taking appropriate action when delinquent. During 2012, we evaluated a means to monitor non-Regions-serviced first liens using a third-party service provider and found that the delinquency rates were not material. As of December 31, 2012, none of our home equity lines of credit have converted to mandatory amortization under the contractual terms.

Our profitability depends to a large extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income received on interest-earning assets (primarily loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and borrowings). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve System (the ?FOMC?) and market interest rates.</P>

However, the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by longer-term interest rates, which are set by the market through benchmark interest rates such as the London Interbank Offered Rates (?LIBOR?) or, at times, the FOMC?s actions, and generally vary from day to day. The level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios. If the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-earning assets, our net interest income may decline and, with it, a decline in our earnings may occur. Our net interest income and earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest-earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities. In particular, short-term interest rates are currently very low by historical standards, with many benchmark rates, such as the federal funds rate and the one- and three-month LIBOR near zero. These low rates have reduced our cost of funding which has caused our net interest margin to increase.</P>

March 2012 stock offering and redemption of 3.5 million shares of Series A preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. Additionally, in March 2012 Fitch conducted a global review of securities impacted in part by capital requirements set forth in Basel III as well as Fitch?s view regarding the likelihood of sovereign support.

Specifically, when Regions was downgraded below investment grade status, we became unable to reliably access the short-term unsecured funding markets, which caused us to hold more cash and liquid investments to meet our on-going cash needs. Such actions reduced our profitability as these liquid investments earned a lower return than other assets, such as loans. Regions? liquidity policy requires that we maintain a minimum cash requirement that is the greater of the next two years of corporate dividend payments and debt service and maturities less the next one year of bank dividends, or the next one year of corporate dividend payments and debt service and maturities. The current working limit does not allow the minimum cash requirement to fall below $500 million. The conservative nature of this policy helps protect us against the costs of unexpected adverse funding environments. Future issuances of debt could cost Regions more in interest costs were such debt to be issued at our current debt rating. Any future downgrades would further increase the interest costs associated with potential future borrowings, the cost of which cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty of future issuances in terms of amount and priority.</P>

While the exact amount of additional collateral is unknown, it is reasonable to conclude that Regions may be required to post approximately an additional $200 million related to existing contracts with contingent credit features. In early 2013, as a result of the ratings upgrades that occurred during 2012, approximately $70 million of this additional collateral has been returned to Regions.

Additionally, cyber attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking or terrorist activities, could disrupt Regions? or our customers? or other third parties? business operations. For example, in October 2012 and December 2012, a group launched denial of service attacks against a number of large financial services institutions. Regions was targeted by this group in October and December. These events did not result in a breach of Regions? client data, and account information remained secure; however, the attacks did adversely affect the performance of Regions Bank?s website, www.regions.com, and, in some instances, prevented customers from accessing Regions Bank?s secure websites for consumer and commercial applications. The October event was resolved within approximately one day. The December events occurred over multiple days, but each individual event was of a shorter duration than the October event and was promptly resolved. In all cases, the attacks primarily resulted in inconvenience; however, future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging, and Regions may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks.</P>

(?Raymond James?). The transaction closed on April 2, 2012. In connection with the closing of the sale, Regions agreed to indemnify Raymond James for all litigation and certain other matters related to pre-closing activities of Morgan Keegan. Indemnifiable losses under the indemnification provision include legal and other expenses, such as costs for defense, judgments, settlements and awards associated with the resolution of litigation related to pre-closing activities. As of December 31, 2012 the carrying value of the indemnification obligation is approximately $345 million. This amount reflects an estimate of liability, and actual liabilities can potentially be higher than amounts reserved. The amount of liability that we may ultimately incur from indemnification claims may have an adverse impact, perhaps materially, on our results of operations.</P>

These regulations govern a variety of matters, including certain debt obligations, changes in control of bank holding companies and state-chartered banks, maintenance of adequate capital by bank holding companies and state-chartered banks, and general business operations and financial condition of Regions and Regions Bank (including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments, the amount of reserves against deposits, restrictions on dividends, establishment of branch offices, and the maximum interest rate that may be charged by law).

We generally cannot control the amount of premiums we will be required to pay for FDIC insurance. High levels of bank failures over the past several years and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits have increased resolution costs to the FDIC and put pressure on the Deposit Insurance Fund (?DIF?). In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the DIF, the FDIC increased assessment rates on insured institutions, charged a special assessment to all insured institutions as of June 30, 2009, and required banks to prepay three years? worth of premiums on December 30, 2009. If there are additional financial institution failures, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels, or the FDIC may charge additional special assessments. Further, the FDIC increased the DIF?s target reserve ratio to 2.0 percent of insured deposits following the Dodd-Frank Act?s elimination of the 1.5 percent cap on the DIF?s reserve ratio. Additional increases in our assessment rate may be required in the future to achieve this targeted reserve ratio.

The FDIC also adopted a revised risk-based assessment calculation in February 2011. In January 2010, the FDIC proposed a rule tying assessment rates of FDIC insured institutions to the institution?s employee compensation programs. Comments were due on February 18, 2010, but as of February 2013, no final rule has been adopted.

From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. In light of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements contained in the Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal Reserve?s proposed rules implementing regulatory accords on international banking institutions formulated as part of the Basel Committee III process, we expect to be required to satisfy additional, more stringent, capital adequacy and liquidity standards. We may also be required to satisfy additional, more stringent capital adequacy and liquidity standards than those specified as part of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal Reserve?s proposed rules implementing Basel III, or comply with the requirements of these standards earlier than might otherwise be required, in order to successfully comply with the capital planning and stress test rules and guidance issued by the Federal Reserve. The ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards on us cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including the treatment and implementation by the U.S. banking regulators.

Acquisition of 10 percent or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company or state member bank, including shares of our common stock, creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer ?controls? the bank holding company or state member bank. Also, as noted under the ?Supervision and Regulation? section of Item 1. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any bank, including Regions Bank. There also are provisions in our certificate of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. For example, holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have certain voting rights that could adversely affect share value. If and when dividends on the preferred stock have not been declared and paid for at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), the authorized number of directors then constituting our Board of Directors will automatically be increased by two, and the preferred stockholders will be entitled to elect the two additional directors. Also, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all of the then-outstanding shares of the preferred stock is required to consummate a binding share-exchange or reclassification involving the preferred stock, or a merger or consolidation of Regions with or into another entity, unless certain requirements are met.

The economic slowdown and loss of confidence in financial institutions over the past several years may increase our cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. Additionally, some of our long-term debt securities are currently rated below investment grade by certain of the credit ratings agencies. Any such ratings may affect our cost of funding and limit our access to the capital markets.</P>

Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of Regions Bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of our debt ratings, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.</P>

These issuances of our securities could dilute the voting and economic interests of our existing shareholders.</P>
