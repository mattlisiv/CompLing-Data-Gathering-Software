We created the market for medication dispensing machines that automate the management of medications from the pharmacy to the nursing unit. We were the first to integrate automated supply dispensing systems with clinical information systems that enable clinicians to chart, charge and reorder supplies. We have integrated our products with numerous other information systems within the hospital, including financial and business systems that support patient admissions, discharges and transfers, operational systems that include inventory management and clinical systems that include pharmacy information and electronic medical records.

The Alaris System utilizes our proprietary Guardrails software application that alerts a clinician when an infusion parameter is outside the institution?s pre-established limitations (known as a ?data set?) for that medication, thereby helping hospitals reduce IV medication administration errors. Using a centralized server, data sets and continuous quality improvement (?CQI?) data from the Alaris System can be managed wirelessly. CQI data is then evaluated by clinicians and used to determine best practices and refine the data sets.

Our VELA ventilator offers a comprehensive range of modalities for pediatric and adult patients requiring either invasive or non-invasive ventilator support in both acute and alternate care settings. Our LTV Series ventilators provide portable invasive and non-invasive ventilation, and are used worldwide in a variety of care settings. Based on their compact size and versatility, LTV Series ventilators are used in critical care, emergency departments, long term care and home care, as well as emergency transport and military applications. Several of our ventilator systems, including the LTV Series ventilators, use only dedicated disposable ventilator circuits in the provision of respiratory therapy. Accordingly, when we sell an LTV Series ventilator, the sale results in a long-term revenue stream associated with the dedicated disposables.</P>

Our HFOV products are primarily used to treat children and premature infants who suffer from acute respiratory failure and adults who suffer from acute lung injury. SiPAP is a unique form of non-invasive support for infants, which has been shown to lower work of breathing and reduce the need for more costly invasive forms of support.</P>

The FDA?s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months, but it can last longer. The process of obtaining PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain. It generally takes from one to three years or even longer. The FDA announced recommendations following two task force investigations into the agency?s medical device 510(k) clearance process. While the FDA is currently not making regulatory changes in direct correlation to these recommendations, the FDA could make changes through its administrative process that would make the 510(k) clearance process and PMA approval more expensive for us, and could  result in delays of future launches of new or modified medical devices.

Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, most of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In the sale, delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the United States, we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations, including those administered by the Department of Treasury?s Office of Foreign Assets Control (?OFAC?) and the Department of Commerce?s Bureau of Industry and Security (?BIS?) which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries and/or with certain individuals identified by the United States government. Despite our global trade and compliance program, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.

In the United States, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and similar state agencies administer laws that restrict the emission of pollutants into the air, discharges of pollutants into bodies of water and disposal of pollutants on the ground. Violations of these laws can result in significant civil and criminal penalties and incarceration. The failure to obtain a permit for certain activities may be a violation of environmental law and subject the owner and operator to civil and criminal sanctions. Most environmental agencies also have the power to shut down an operation if it is operating in violation of environmental law. United States laws also typically allow citizens to bring private enforcement actions in some situations. Outside the United States, the environmental laws and their enforcement vary and may be more burdensome. For example, some European countries impose environmental taxes or require manufacturers to take back used products at the end of their useful life, and others restrict the materials that manufacturers may use in their products and require redesign and labeling of products. Although such laws do not currently have a significant impact on our products, they are expanding rapidly in Europe. We have management programs and processes in place that are intended to minimize the potential for violations of these laws.</P>

Regulations are subject to change as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial action, which may further increase our costs or reduce sales.

Modifications or enhancements to a product that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, technology, materials, labeling, packaging, or manufacturing process may also require a new 510(k) clearance.

In March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform legislation was signed into law in the United States through the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. Among other initiatives, the legislation provides for a 2.3% annual excise tax on the sales of certain medical devices in the United States, commencing in January 2013. We will record this excise tax as a selling, general and administrative expense, which will have an adverse affect on our operating expenses and results of operations. We currently expect the impact of the tax to be approximately $15 million to $20 million in our fiscal year 2013, rising to approximately $30 million to $40 million annually thereafter. In addition, as the United States federal government implements additional provisions of healthcare reform, we anticipate that Congress, regulatory agencies and  certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access. Public debate of these issues will likely continue in the future. We cannot predict with certainty what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the state level, or what ultimate effect federal healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation may have on our customers' purchasing decisions regarding our products and services.

The amount of additional tax proposed by the IRS in these notices totals $462 million, excluding penalties and interest, which may be significant. In addition, during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 we received an IRS Revenue Agent's Report for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 that included Notices of Proposed Adjustment related to transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries.

We are currently before the IRS Appeals office related to the fiscal years 2003 through 2007, and we are engaged in substantive discussions with the IRS Appeals office related to our 2003 through 2005 fiscal years.

In addition, Cardinal Health received opinions of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, co-counsel to Cardinal Health, to the effect that the contribution and the distribution qualified as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code.
