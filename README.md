# CompLing-Data-Gathering-Software

This is a program I began development on in my sophmore year of college. It is used to annotate sentiment words in text documents. 
There is a specific XML structure used to parse text and allow for annotation. My goal is to breakout parts of this program and
further the usability and flexibility to properly annotate text with speed. 

Because I began this project in my early days of learning development, the project quickly built and I did not engineer it to the
best of my current ability. I hope to improve on many functions in the future.
